Anti-Stipulator 99.99 User Manual

by Lydia Chan and Neil Prajapati

        Congratulations on your new Anti-Stipulator 99.99. The program should be pretty straightforward and easy to use, but below are some basic instructions and tips for using this product. 
        The AntiStipulator.jar is a program that allows you to test Karels in a variety of worlds with ease. When you open it, it pops up a window which has a Karel world to which you can add things to. You can add beepers, walls and Karels. When the run button is pressed, the MainDriver with your world and your Karels will be created, it will run, and your Karel’s task method will be called. 


Instructions
1. Double-click the AntiStipulator.jar file to start the program. DO SO BEFORE OPENING BLUEJ. The AntiStipulator.jar file will create certain files that BlueJ will need to use.
2. If you want to copy the contents of a Karel world inside your folder, choose the world it in the 2nd drop down. 
3. Select the function of the mouse by clicking on a choice in the drop down menu to the right. After selecting a certain function, click on the desired corner to place or remove a component. For example, if you click on “Add Beeper,” a beeper will appear when you press on a corner.
4. If you wish to delete a World Item, simply press the World Item’s corresponding remove button and then press on the corner on which you want to remove the World Item. For example, if you wanted to remove a beeper from the (1,1) corner, you would simply click on the “Remove Beeper” button and then click on the (1,1) corner.
5. Open BlueJ.
6. Now go into the file of a Karel you wish to test. At the top of the file write:
                import kareltester.*;


        Then make your class implement TestableKarel:
        public class MyRobot extends Robot implements TestableKarel


Finally, write the task method. The task method will be called when the AntiStipulator runs your Karel program.
        public void task(){
                //your code goes here
}
(See example below)
1. After creating a world for your Karel, you can add your Karel into the world: choose the Karel you wish to place using the drop down menu on the right, and then clicking on the corner where the Karel should go. If you do not see your Karel in the drop down menu, “Refresh Karels.”
2. After you have placed your Karels, run the World with the “Run” button. A new window should pop up, and Karels will be instantiated and their task methods will run.
3. If your Karels are not working, you can easily fix your code in BlueJ, compile, and run your code. If you wish to test your Karel in a different World, simply change your world and run again.


Activity:
Use this program to test the Karpeter Robot. 
If the Karpeter fails, fix the bugs in the Karpeter class: use the Antistipulator to test your code. Be sure to test corner cases (i.e., no “rooms” for the Karpeter to carpet or beepers already in the rooms). 


Tips: 
1. To place the desired number of beepers on the corner, press the “Add Beeper” button the desired number of times. 
2. The program removes beepers from the corner one at a time. 
3. Have fun and Karel on. 


The following is an example of a Karel that the AntiStipulator can test:


import kareltherobot.*;
import kareltester.*;
public class MyBot extends Robot implements TestableKarel
{
   
    public MyBot(int st, int av, Direction dir, int b)
    {
        super(st, av,dir,b);
    }
    
    public void carpetRooms()
    {
        checkWall();
        System.out.println("hi");
        while(frontIsClear())
        {
            move();
            checkWall();
        }
    }
    
    public void checkWall()
    {
        turnLeft();
        move();
        turnRight();
        boolean okay = true;
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            if(frontIsClear())okay = false;
            turnLeft();
        }
        if(okay) putBeeper();
        move();
        turnLeft();
    }
    
    public void task()
    {
        carpetRooms();
    }
    
    private void turnRight()
    {
        turnLeft(); turnLeft(); turnLeft();
    }
}
